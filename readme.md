# NEKO DEX ðŸ˜º- A Cute Cat-Themed DeFi Protocol on Polygon and OKX Networks

## Problem Statement: <br>

The traditional financial system often lacks transparency, accessibility, and inclusivity. Additionally, many charitable organizations struggle to raise funds consistently. To address these challenges, NEKO DEX aims to provide a decentralized finance (DeFi) solution on the Polygon and OKX networks while supporting a cat charity foundation. The project seeks to create an engaging and user-friendly interface to encourage participation and donations within the crypto community.

## Objective: <br>

The main objective of NEKO DEX is to combine DeFi services with charitable giving, leveraging the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The project aims to achieve the following:

### 1. Enable Decentralized Exchanges <br>

NEKO DEX offers a decentralized exchange platform on the Polygon and OKX networks, allowing users to swap cryptocurrencies seamlessly while generating fees for the cat charity foundation.

### 2. Liquidity Provision <br>

Users can provide liquidity to the NEKO DEX ecosystem by participating in various dessert-themed liquidity pools. Liquidity providers earn rewards while contributing to the stability and liquidity of the platform.

### 3. Charitable Donations <br>

All fees collected from swaps are donated to a cat charity foundation, fostering a culture of giving within the crypto community.

### 4. User Engagement <br>

The visually appealing and interactive user interface, inspired by a cat cafe, creates an engaging experience for participants. Elements such as the bulletin board, leaderboard, and staking feature encourage user interaction and participation.

The staking feature allows users to earn points based on the LP tokens they provide, the duration of their participation, and a scaling factor. This incentivizes liquidity provision and rewards participants who contribute the most to the NEKO DEX ecosystem.
