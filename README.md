![home](/Screenshots/home.png?raw=true)

## Problem Statement: <br>

The traditional financial system often lacks transparency, accessibility, and inclusivity. Additionally, many charitable organizations struggle to raise funds consistently. To address these challenges, NEKO DEX aims to provide a decentralized finance (DeFi) solution on the Polygon and OKX networks while supporting a cat charity foundation. The project seeks to create an engaging and user-friendly interface to encourage participation and donations within the crypto community.

## Objective: <br>

The main objective of NEKO DEX is to combine DeFi services with charitable giving, leveraging the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The project aims to achieve the following:

### 1. Enable Decentralized Exchanges <br>

NEKO DEX offers a decentralized exchange platform on the Polygon and OKX networks, allowing users to swap cryptocurrencies seamlessly while generating fees for the cat charity foundation.

### 2. Liquidity Provision <br>

Users can provide liquidity to the NEKO DEX ecosystem by participating in various dessert-themed liquidity pools. Liquidity providers earn rewards while contributing to the stability and liquidity of the platform.

### 3. Charitable Donations <br>

All fees collected from swaps are donated to a cat charity foundation, fostering a culture of giving within the crypto community.

### 4. User Engagement <br>

The visually appealing and interactive user interface, inspired by a cat cafe, creates an engaging experience for participants. Elements such as the bulletin board, leaderboard, and staking feature encourage user interaction and participation.

# Features
  ### 1. <b> Decentralized Exchange </b> <br/>
   Swap tokens, and provide liquidity to generate fees, which are donated.
  ###  2. <b> Liquidity Provider Leaderboard </b>

## Additional Details <br>

NEKO DEX emphasizes transparency, with a live tracker displaying the total amount donated in US dollars. This provides users with real-time updates on the impact their transactions are making towards the cat charity foundation.
